“The monthly data fluctuates so we rely on the yearly record for a more concrete analysis of criminal activities,” DSP Umesh Raj Joshi, acting spokesperson of Nepal Police, told the Post. “ However, the number of recorded crimes is increasing because the number of people reporting criminal cases is also on the rise.”

Similarly, 384 programmes to increase awareness about the ill effects of drug use were organised.

“Along with increasing awareness among the public, Nepal Police are also looking closely into investigations of unsolved cases,” said Joshi. “Nepal Police has also increased the use of technology and resources to solve criminal cases.”

The digital forensic lab of the police is said to have examined 159 evidences while the central police forensic science laboratory has examined 987 evidences in the last month.
